## Core Mechanic
In Schorremorrie, you'll be using a D20 to determine the success of various tasks. Roll the D20 and add your relevant attribute to meet the target number, which can vary based on the task's difficulty: 10 for easy tasks, 15 for normal tasks, and 20 for hard tasks.

With "advantage," you make two rolls and select the higher result, while in a situation of "disadvantage," you make two rolls and choose the lower result.

## Chargen

In this role-playing system, characters have three primary attributes - Fortitude, Dexterity, and Willpower - determined by rolling 1d6 and adding 2 to each, with a maximum value of 10 for each.
Derived stats are calculated as follows:

- HP is based on Fortitude.
- Inventory capacity is twice the character's Fortitude score. The Inventory stat represents the character's capacity to carry equipment, scars, and mutations, with small items allowing three items per slot.
- Psyche is determined by multiplying the character's Willpower score by 2. Psyche encompasses spells, skills, followers, beliefs, and emotional scars, serving as a repository for the character's mental and magical attributes.
Players select a character class and apply the template A. They may also choose to incorporate one or more personal beliefs into their Psyche.

Armor provides protection by allowing 1 point of armor to negate 1 point of damage.

Characters can acquire skills that reduce the difficulty of certain tasks, making them more proficient in those areas.

### Beliefs
When a character in this system decides to take a potentially lethal risk to uphold one of their personal beliefs, at the end of the gaming session, they have the option to make a significant change related to that belief. They can choose to replace the belief with a follower (someone who shares or supports that belief), acquire a new skill that reflects the experience gained from their belief-driven actions, or remove an emotional scar that may have resulted from their previous encounters or challenges.

### Casting spells

In this system, characters have Spell Dice (SD) based on their class, representing their magical abilities. When a character casts a spell, they choose an invested Spell Dice, roll it, and if the result is 4 or higher, they lose that specific Spell Dice until they take a long rest.

Rolling doubles, triples, or quadruples on the Spell Dice grants the character 1, 3, or 6 doom points, respectively. These doom points can lead to significant consequences. After accumulating doom points, the player must roll a D20. If the result is greater than or equal to their total doom point count, a catastrophic event or consequence known as a "catastrophe" occurs.

Characters can also have a personal symbol called a Sigil, which has a maximum limit equal to the total number of their Spell Dice. The Sigil may have various magical properties, and it can cause permanency, allowing its effects to persist. 

### Melee Weapons

- Improvised: 1D4 damage, throwable.
- Light: 1D6 damage, throwable, usable in the off-hand.
- Medium: 1D8 damage (1D10 with two hands).
- Heavy: 1D12 damage, two-handed.
- Pole: 1D8 damage, two-handed, advantage against hit creatures.
- Two-Weapon Fighting: Free off-hand attack on a miss with the main hand.

### Ranged Weapons
- Light (e.g., darts): 1 damage, can attack twice.
- Medium (e.g., sling): 1D4 damage.
- Heavy (e.g., bow): 1D6 damage, requires both hands.
- Mechanical (e.g., crossbow, musket): 1D12 damage, requires both hands, must take one action to recharge.

## Combat
In this system, there is no initiative roll. Player characters (PCs) automatically act first in combat unless they are caught by surprise. During each character's turn in combat, they have the opportunity to execute a Move action, speak, and take a full Action.

### Attacking
To make an attack, a player rolls a twenty-sided die (D20) and adds their Dexterity (DEX) modifier to the result. Rolling a natural 20 on the D20 results in dealing double damage to the target. Conversely, for dodging enemy attacks, players roll a D20 and add their Dexterity (DEX) modifier to the roll. Rolling a natural 1 on the D20 means taking double damage from the incoming attack.

### Damage
In this system, when a character's hit points (HP) reach 0, they enter a dying state. For each point of damage they receive below 0 HP, they accumulate 1 wound. At the end of their turn, they accrue an additional wound. To stabilize and avoid death, a character must succeed in a hard Fortitude roll. Alternatively, another character can attempt to stabilize them by making a hard Willpower roll. If a character receives HP while in a stabilized state, they cease dying, but they gain a scar as a result. The scar comes with a description, and all rolls related to relevant dangers become easier for the character.

### Recovering Damage
Rest and recovery play crucial roles in this system. A character can fully restore their HP by taking an 8-hour rest and consuming one ration. At the end of a gaming session, characters can receive medical care to remove all their wounds.

## Exploration

### Indoors
When exploring indoor environments, each relevant action takes approximately 10 minutes. There's a chance of random encounters with one roll every 30 minutes, and torches are consumed at a rate of one torch every 10 minutes. Characters can traverse approximately 10 rooms in 10 minutes, though this number decreases to 3 rooms in 10 minutes if they choose to move stealthily.

#### Outdoors
Outdoor exploration is divided into time blocks known as "Days," with segments including Dawn, Midday, Afternoon, Dusk, Evening, and Night. Each relevant action consumes one of these time blocks, and random encounters may occur when entering a location, exploring a location, or resting.

### Treasures

Treasures come in different categories 
- Trash, which holds no value
- Mundane, represented by bags of silver coins 
- Valuable, containing bags of golden coins
- Treasure, comprising bags of platinum coins. 

- Each bag of coins occupies 1 inventory slot, and it's important to note that 8 Mundane items are equivalent to 4 Valuable items, which, in turn, are equivalent to 1 Treasure.
