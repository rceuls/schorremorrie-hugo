# The Specialist

## Starting Equipment
Roll a [failed career](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html)

## Starting Skills
Your failed career, and your choice of Climbing, Disguises, Lying, or Stealth.

## Templates

For every Specialist template you have, you learn a new Trick.

- A: Scrounge
- B: Expertise
- C: Bonus Trick
- D: Mastery

### Trick

Roll twice on the trick list below and choose one. Re-roll tricks you can already do.

### Scrounge

Once per room at the discretion of the referee, digging through trash, you can get an item rolled on the 1D200 Failed Medieval Careers table.

### Expertise

Choose one skill you have. You automatically succeed on skill rolls with this skill, as you are an expert.

### Mastery

You can achieve things beyond the scope of your skills:

- If you are skilled in Climbing, you can climb any surface, even upside down.
- If you are skilled in Disguises, you may declare that you are leaving the area then later declare yourself to have been one of other minor NPCs present all along, friend or enemy. You can also just walk back in undisguised.
- If you are skilled in Lying, once per session, you can redo your turn if you are unhappy with how it went down.
- If you are skilled in Stealth, you can vanish out of thin air if you succeed on a stealth roll.

1. Archeologist: Once per day, you can speak with ancient objects or bones.
1. Assassin: For every non-trivial fact (something you can’t learn from glancing around) you know about your target, you have +1D6 to your attack and damage rolls. Usable once per fact per target.

1. Fashionable: Fancy clothes count as pieces of armor and don’t take up any inventory slots.

1. Wizkid: You can take 10 minutes to repair any non magical object for 10 minutes.
