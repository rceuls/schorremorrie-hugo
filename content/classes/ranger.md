### Animal Companion
You start with an animal companion, which can be any mundane animal horse-sized or smaller. Compared to regular pets, your companion can follow more complex commands and doesn’t require an action to direct. All pets have HP and STR, but they fall unconscious at 0 HP and begin taking injuries at 0 STR. If your companion dies, you can find another.

### Survivalist
You have advantage on foraging and against environmental effects.

### Wilderness Sense
Omens occur on a 2 or 3 on the encounter die rather than just 2. When a random encounter occurs outside, you can draw or modify the terrain map and starting positions (GM discretion).

### Forecast
You can predict (choose) season-appropriate weather for the next day, succeeding on a 5-in-6, -1 for every consecutive successful prediction. You can detect but not create natural disasters.

### Trophies
You can collect trophies from corpses. Each trophy takes up 1 Inventory Slot and gives you +1 damage against that type of creature.

### Practiced Eye
If you miss a ranged attack, your next attack against that target has advantage.

### Titan Slayer
Once per day, you can deal +X damage with an attack, where X is the HD (roughly equivalent to level) of the highest HD creature the party has slain with your help.

### Speak with Animals
You can understand the body language and vocalizations of wild animals, and they can understand yours. This isn’t as good as real speech, but it’s much better than what other people can achieve, nearly supernatural.
