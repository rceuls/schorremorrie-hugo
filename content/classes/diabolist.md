## Starting Equipment

A black goat. A forked dagger. A capirote. A spell book, a quill, but no ink.

## Starting Skills

Your choice of Secret Cultist, Lazy Student, or Corrupted Courtesan.

## Templates
For every Diabolist template you have, you gain one extra Spell Dice and Diabolic Spell. Diabolists get a second random spell from the diabolist school at level 1. They’re stored in your Psyche and you spend Spell Dice to cast them.
Because of the taboo you’ve broken as a diabolist, you also gain a Doom Point each time you roll a 6 on a Spell Dice.
- A: Diabolic Magic, Doomed Pact, Signs of the Devil
- B: Sinful
- C: +1 sin
- D: Dark Reward

### Doomed Pact
You can clear all your [doom] by performing a random obligation for a devil (roll 1D8 on both the obligation and sin tables):

#### Obligations
1. Sacrifice 2 creatures consumed with ...
1. Corrupt 1 creature into practicing relentless ...
1. Lure 1 creature infested with another sin into also practicing ...
1. Form a mob of 6 creatures to lynch a target who you accuse of ...
1. Smear 1 upstanding, powerful creature with false evidence of ...
1. Blackmail 1 influential creature into committing an act of ...
1. Inflame a murderous rivalry in 3 creatures over an act of ...
1. Convince a creature to kill innocents.

#### Sins
1. Wrath
2. Sloth
3. Envy
4. Pride
5. Gluttony
6. Greed
7. Lust
8. Roll Twice

### Signs of the Devil

- When you enter a room, all lights flicker and other people's pets become aggressive to you.
- You and your possessions are unharmed by any fires smaller than a campfire.
- You can see through the eyes of goats that you’ve touched as long as you know where they are. One at a time.

### Sinful

If you have chosen to go down the path of dealing with devils, it is because of your own weakness. Choose the sin that brought you here:

- **Wrath**. You can inflict [doom] fire damage to any target you can see. You gain a _Doom Point_ if it survives, and lose one if it dies.
- **Sloth**. You can sacrifice skills you know to gain new followers when you are in town. Each skill you have increases your [doom] by 1.
- **Envy**. Once per day, you can make a copy of a hand-held object or vestment owned by someone else you can see. You gain a _Doom Point_ every time you use it.
- **Pride**. You can reroll any D20 you roll. Each time you fail a reroll, you gain a _Doom Point_.
- **Gluttony**. Eating a daily ration removes a _Doom Point_. Eating five daily rations in a day cures 1 Wound. You gain 3 _Doom Points_ every day.
- **Greed**. Each inventory slot taken by a Valuable or Treasure increases your HP by 1. You gain a _Doom Point_ every time one leaves your inventory.
- **Lust**. Sentient creatures with less HP than your [doom] are overwhelmed by you. They must save to attack, hurt, or say anything bad about you as long as you dont attack them.

### Dark Reward

Here's the reward you bargained for. You get those related to your two sins. Hope everything goes fine!

- **Wrath**. One person, object, or building of your choice explodes. Everybody interested hates you for it.
- **Sloth**. Your spirit leaves your body behind, which becomes completely helpless. You are permanently astrally projection within 40' of it.
- **Envy**. Get any one thing you are aware of. Everybody knows you have it.
- **Pride**. Erase any mistake or humiliation from your past. You now fumble on rolls of 1, 2 or 3 at the referee's discretion.
- **Gluttony**. You can eat _anything_. You can never eat the same thing twice.
- **Greed**. You gain 1 000 big bags of gold. You cant spend them.
- **Lust**. You have an extra life after this one. You cannot say no to an offer of a new experience.

## Spells

### Spellbook

#### 1. Fireball
**R**: 200’ **T**: 20’ diameter **D**: 0

Objects and people take [sum] damage.

#### 2. Smell Sin
**R**: sight **T**: [sum] creatures **D**: concentration

By focusing your attention on a creature, you can smell [dice] sins it embraces and has committed most recently. Greed is a stench of rotting wood and old locks, burlap bags and musty hiding spots. Wrath is the coppery smell of blood and oiled steel. Sloth is the smell of piss saturated sheets and room temperature beer. Envy smells delicious.

#### 3. Monsterize
**R**: touch **T**: creature **D**: 10 min

Target saves or becomes a horrible monster version of itself. Monsters get +1 HD (+4 max HP, +1 to hit, +1 to save). Player characters have their Strength raised to 15 (unless it was already higher). The target also flies into a rage, and becomes incapable of tactics, kindness, or retreat, even if urged by friends.

#### 4. Invert Speech
**R**: 10 x [dice] radius **T**: [sum] creatures **D**: [dice] minutes

Targets in the radius of this spell must Save or either perceive all writing within range or all conversation as saying the opposite of what is intended. Words and tone will be twisted as subtly as possible.

#### 5. Flay
**R**: 100’ **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: 0

Creatures of your choice with [HD] greater then or equal to [dice] take [sum]/2 damage and have their skin (should they have skin) removed and fall at their feet. Save for half. If this kills a creature, their skin is neatly pinned to the nearest flat surface.

#### 6. Socialize
**R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [dice] hours

You are clad in the typical garb of the region. 1 [die] gets you the lowest form of clothing. 2 [dice] gets you robes of the middle class or equivalent. 3 [dice] gets you noble clothing. 4 [dice] is truly sumptuous clothing. You also gain the ability to judge social status accurately from unfamiliar clothing while the spell is active.

#### 7. Look!
**R**: 10 x [dice] radius centered on you **T**: [sum] creatures D: 0

You point and shout at something oh god what is that. Save or look. If 3 or more [dice] are invested, creatures may actually believe they see something.

#### 8. Murderer’s Hands+
**R**: 30’ **T**: [size] creatures **D**: [sum] minutes

Targets must Save or their hands or equivalent appendages twist into hooked, serrated metal appendages whose damage varies. 1 [die]: 1d4, 2 [dice]: 1d6 3 [dice]: 1d8 4 [dice]: 1d10. They cannot use these hands for anything but harm.

#### 9. Pyre
**R**: 100' **T**: [sum] creatures or objects D: 0

Targets must Save or catch on fire. Targets that are completely inflammable (soaked creatures, metal, etc.) do not need to Save. Targets that are very flammable (soaked in oil, dry wood) may not get a Save. You can target this spell precisely enough to light the wick of a single candle in a bundle, provided you can see the wick.

#### 10. Sermon
**R**: voice **T**: [sum] + [dice] creatures **D**: [sum] minutes

You deliver a passionate speech about whatever topic you wish. Targets must Save or remember what you said and discuss it with other creatures compulsively for [dice] days.

#### 11. Entangling Smoke
**R**: 50' **T**: [dice]x2 objects or creatures **D**: varies

Target creature or object is grabbed by tendrils of thick black smoke. Save to negate, prone creatures automatically fail. Target moves at half speed and takes a -2 penalty to Attack until it can win an opposed Strength test against the smoke to end the effect. The effective Strength of the smoke depends on the dice invested. 1 [die]: 10, 2 [dice]: 14, 3 [dice]: 18, 4 [dice] 20.

#### 12. Emotionate
**R**: 10 x [dice] **T**: [sum] creatures **D**: [dice] hours

Target creatures must Save or have their current state of emotion amplified. Sad creatures become inconsolable, angry creatures vibrate with rage, lustful creatures become obsessive. Creatures that are not feeling any strong emotions will have their next emotion (reaction) magnified.

#### 13. Apocalypse Now
**R**: sight **T**: [sum] creatures and self **D**: concentration

When you cast this spell, roll your dice.
If one 6 comes up, things go subtly wrong in the given area. Crows with human eyes. That steel dagger is actually painted wood. Just unsettling enough to be noticeable, but easy to rationalize.
If 2 6’s come up, things go wrong. All target creatures take [dice] damage and witness the frayed edges of the world. Colors shift. The sky is green. The sun is your teacher with a black snake in her hand, watching. Leaves shuffle along the ground like snails, and when they move over your feet, they scrape them to the bone.
If 3 6’s come up, shit is fucked. Mother goats suckle at the behinds of their kids and wander away from the small, wrinkled lumps of skin left behind. Tree branches wilt into roots that plunge greedily into exposed flesh. There is a second heartbeat inside your skin, and you feel a pressure like tautened fabric in your neck. Something is stirring. If you play with insanity points, break them out. All creatures within range except you take [dice] + [size] damage. If this reduces them to zero hit points, a demon arm with an impossibly long nail reaches out of their throat and slits them neatly down the middle, then crawling out. These demons are indifferent to you and hostile to everyone else.
If 4 6’s come up…nothing happens. The world stops for a complete second and then carries on. For the rest of your life, though, occasionally things will seem different. Honey was a lighter color and silk wasn't so thick. Was the sky always green?
Regardless of 6’s, if your [sum] = 13, then in 13 days Old Scratch will unzip you like a coat, stretch, and proceed to commit unspeakable acts on the nearest civilized populations until put down. You know this.

Casting this spell is a great way to invite erasure by the normative reality matrices unless it succeeds completely.
