- A: Weapon Training, Parry
- B: Fighting Style
- C: Steel Gaze
- D: Weapon Mastery

### Weapon Training

Your weapons have different effects depending on the type of damage you inflict with them:

- Bludgeoning: You can roll FOR after you hit to knock the target prone.
- Piercing: Hitting a prone or suprised target inflicts 1D6 extra damage.
- Slashing: Once per round, when you roll 1 or 2 on your damage, you can make another attack.

### Parry

Once per battle, you can destroy a weapon or a shied you are holding to protect yourself or an adjacent ally from an attack’s damage.

### Fighting Style

Choose one of the fighting styles listed further downwards .

### Steel Gaze

You project an intimidating aura that lets people know you are a skilled warrior. At any moment, you can decide how weak creatures react to you: they either avoid fighting you at all costs, or gang up on you, ignoring your teammates. Weak creatures are any monster with 2 HD or less.

### Weapon Mastery

Your weapons have different effects depending on the type of damage you inflict with them:

- Bludgeoning: Damaging a non-gigantic target knocks it prone.
- Piercing: Damaging a prone or surprised unnamed living target kills it.
- Slashing: You make two attacks.

## Fighting styles

### Nervous Hunter
You are as tense as your bowstring. When you have your ranged weapon ready, you can interrupt the referee at any moment to shoot whatever they are describing. You have the advantage if you do not know what the target is yet. If you hit an actual danger to you or your friends, you are calmed for the rest of your day.

### Focused Loner
Hush! Take a deep breath. When you close your eyes and don’t speak, you can ~feel~ the presence of any other creature in the room with you (or looking at you if outdoors). When you do so, you can interact and fight with any adjacent being as if you could see them.

### Daring Swashbuckler
Your dashing exploits have earned you a nickname in the area. Choose it. You can now attempt a melee combat maneuver AND use a ranged weapon on your turn. Doing so increases your nickname’s fame.

### Stubborn Guardian
No one fucks with you. Once per encounter, you can loudly proclaim that IT ENDS HERE! When you do, you gain 1D6 temporary Hit Points and, as long as you don’t move from where you stand, can block as much space as a large horse.

### Lucky Bastard
You’re so lucky you seem to dance through life. As long as you have a free hand, you can switch position with any creature that attacks you in melee or that you attack in melee.

### Exuberant Brute
You are bigger than life. Any heavy, two-handed melee weapon or oversized, heavy object wielded by you inflicts 2D6 damage as long as you yell. Who cares if you attract more foes!?

### Devoted Companion
Duty is bigger than you. If you are adjacent, you can heroically take a hit for a person or a thing you have sworn to protect. You must decide before knowing if the spell or attack hits. When you do so, you take 1 less damage, but have disadvantage on your dodge roll* or saving throw to avoid the attack.

### Drunken Sailor
Red cheeks, slurred speech and half-closed eyes. Being drunk does not impede your ability to fight or swim. In fact, it allows you to do both at the same time and to hold your breath twice longer, even while you take damage.

### Gritty Veteran
Each time you begin a new adventure, you can tell your group about a violent event from your past and carve a notch in one of your weapons. You have advantage on your damage rolls with this weapon in situations similar to that anecdote, at the referee’s discretion.

### Resourceful Trickster
You always have a tool ready: all items smaller than your hand on yourself or on adjacent allies count as being in your quick draw slots and are hidden from view. You can pass them to anybody within throwing range without rolling.

### Proud Duelist
Honor dictates that all conflicts are personal. You can challenge any creature with a language to a duel. Until one of you dies or yields by dropping their weapons, you cannot challenge another creature. When your rival misses an attack against you, you can make a free attack with your off-hand.

### Professional Pugilist
Proper people fight naked. Your fists inflict 1D4 damage. When you are not wearing any piece of armor, you can attack twice with them. When you have 3 or less items in your inventory, you can also attempt a combat maneuver at the same time.
