## Starting Equipment

A Black spellbook, Ink and Quill, And your choice of a Shovel, a Surgeon Kit, or the Skull of your ancestor.

## Starting Skills
Your choice of Mortuary Cult Embalmer, Renegade Archeologist, Local Occultist, or Mad Doctor.

## Templates
For every Necromancer template you have, you gain one extra Spell Dice, you can endure an extra 2 Wounds before you die, and, if you have your spellbook, learn a new Necromantic Spell.

- A: Necromantic Magic, The Threshold of Death
- B: Harvest
- C: The Three Faces
- D: Undeath

### Necromantic Magic
Necromancers get a second random spell from the Necromancy school at level 1. You can alternatively choose to learn the Lichcraft spell instead. They’re stored in your Psyche and you spend Spell Dice to cast them.

Because you focus on such dark arts, you begin each adventure chased by the Church.

### The Threshold of Death
What is death? Being wounded does not make you fall unconscious and start dying. However, you still die when you reach your Wound limit. You can give yourself 1 Wound to add 1 SD to a spell you are casting.

This dark magic takes a toll on your body: Medical care can only heal as many Wounds between your adventures as you have Necromancer Templates.

### Harvest
Everytime you rest in a cemetery or the location of a massacre, you can recruit a new follower. This follower is a rotting undead and will be hunted down if understood as such by most humanoids. You can resurrect them by inflicting a Wound to yourself.

### The Three Faces
Each morning when the sun rises, you choose whether you are Living, Undead, or Dead, with all that implies.

- If you are living, you can choose what age you have.
- If you are undead, you heal [dice] when you cast a spell.
- If you are dead, your undead followers have as much HP as you have wounds.

### Undeath
You no longer die when you reach your Wound limit. Instead you lose a limb every time you would die. Consider finding spare limbs or new bodies.

## Spells

### Cantrips
- You can tell if someone's sick, injured, cursed, or otherwise close to death.
- You can cause small plants to wither, food to spoil, and pregnant animals to miscarry if your shadow passes over them.
- You can crudely speak dead languages with no living speakers, but not read them.

### Catastrophes

1. You glimpse death following behind you. Your remaining lifespan is cut down to a maximum of 13 years. This time can be reset by ritualistically murdering someone who's never spilled another's blood. Resetting it doesn't actually extend your lifespan, only postpone the deadline.
1. You feel death's cold fingers on the back of your neck. Your remaining lifespan is cut down to a maximum of 13 months. This time can be reset by ritualistically murdering either 13 people who've never spilled another's blood, or another wizard.
1. You feel death's embrace around you. Your remaining lifespan is cut down to a maximum of 13 hours. There is no way to extend it. Any magic dice you've expended are restored.

### Spellbook
#### 1. Griever's Wail
**R**: 50' **T**: creature(s) **D**: 0

Living creatures within range take [sum] damage divided between them by the caster, save for half. If the [sum] exceeds an undead target's HP, it is compelled to lay itself to rest and de-animate.

#### 2. Corpse Candle
**R**: touch **T**: dead body **D**: 0

Pulls a candle of adipocere from a dead body. Within that candle's light ruined, decayed, and destroyed things appear whole, untarnished, and alive (if applicable). Candles created with this spell last for [sum] minutes, and extinguishing the candle ends the spell.

#### 3. Kiss of Death
**R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: 0

Steals the last breath of a dying and unconscious creature, killing them and temporarily granting both [sum] HP and [dice] skills or bits of knowledge the creature may have possessed. HP granted cannot exceed the creature's maximum. The stolen HP and skills only last as long as you can hold your breath. At touch range the breath can be stored in a bottle for later use. Bottled breaths last [dice] hours.

#### 4. Severed Sentry
**R**: touch **T**: [dice] severed heads **D**: [dice] hours

By closing your eyes you can see, hear, and speak through the affected heads. You can also make them bite if something comes within range. At 3+ dice the heads can fly at 1x their movement while alive and whole.

#### 5. Ectoplasmogenesis
**R**: 30 feet **T**: Broken or ruined objects/structures **D**: [sum] minutes 

Conjures ectoplasm to restore damaged objects to temporary wholesomeness. The max size or number of the object(s) is either [sum] objects small enough to hold in one hand or [sum]x[sum] square feet of material. The restoration happens fast enough that, for example, if you buried spear splinters beneath the floor they'd impale hapless bandits walking over them when restored. 

Ectoplasmogenesis can interact with other necromancer wizard spells in the following ways, and probably other ways too which I haven't thought of but which you may:
- Can affect everything in range of Corpse Candle simultaneously regardless of size.
- Stabilises bottled breaths from Kiss of Death, increasing duration from [dice] hours to [dice] days.
- Grants bodies to Severed Sentries, letting them walk around under your direction
- Renders corpses or corpse parts whole enough to dance for Danse Macabre, even if they've been reduced to ash
- Lets you eat ghosts with Cannibal Repast
- Temporarily recreates your body when you're in a soul jar

#### 6. Danse Macabre
**R**: 50 feet **T**: Creatures and corpses up to [sum] HD and/or [sum] corpses ****D: Concentration

All affected must save or dance for the duration. You must provide music to dance to for the entire duration, though this can be as simple as humming. You can slowly lead the dance in a direction up to 5 ft./round. If you're about to lead a dancer into dangerous circumstances (off a cliff, into a fire, etc.), they immediately get another save. If a dancer is attacked they automatically break out of the spell. If the spell affects a living partner for every dead one, then all targets take disadvantage on their save.

#### 7. Cannibal Repast
**R**: touch **T**: human corpse **D**: 0

People who eat parts of the affected corpse must save or be transformed into ghouls. Up to [dice] people affected will be compelled to see you as a good friend even if they know you're responsible for their transformation, though their primary loyalty will be to their hunger. If the affected corpse is related to them by blood they take disadvantage on their save and you can affect up to [dice]x2. Alternatively, this spell can be used to render [sum] rations worth of human flesh safe for consumption, no diseases or curses transferable.

#### 8. Perchance to Dream
**R**: [sum]x10 feet **T**: sleeping creature **D**: one REM cycle

Enter the dream of a sleeping creature. If they succeed on their save you are just one figure within the dreamscape, and can communicate a message of up to [sum] words they'll remember upon waking. If they fail you gain control of the dream and can design it to your liking. If you make it a nightmare the target will gain no benefits of rest. If you've got a tooth from your target your range becomes [sum] miles and they take disadvantage on their save.

#### 9. Ghostwalk
**R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [sum] rounds

Become translucent and mostly intangible. Non-magical attacks pass through you. You can push through solid matter as if it were thick mud. You can physically interact with other intangible things like ghosts.

#### 10. Saturn's Sickle
**R**: 50 feet **T**: creatures up to [sum]x2 HD or surface of [sum]x10 feet **D**: 0

Sterilizes creatures or surfaces. When cast on creatures they must save or become unable to heal naturally, regenerate, or reproduce until the curse of Saturn's Sickle is removed. They are also cured of any diseases or parasites they might be harbouring. When cast over a surface the same is true of any plants or small animals in the area, and anything that might harbour diseases or parasites is cleansed.

#### 11. Immurement
**R**: 50 feet **T**: creature **D**: 0

Target creature must save or be immediately dragged [sum]x5 feet underground by phantasmal hands. Creatures as big or bigger than an elephant a bonus to their save equal to their HD.

#### 12. Soul Jar
**R**: touch **T**: container **D**: [dice] hours

Transfer your soul into a touched container (the "soul jar"), rendering your body comatose. You can communicate telepathically with anyone within 30 feet of the soul jar. You can also attempt to take over the body of anyone within this range. If they accept this (you can trick or coerce them into accepting this) then they get no save. Resisting targets get a bonus to their save equal to their HD. You can spend points of [sum] for the spell in the following ways:
- Penalise the save to resist on a 1-for-1 basis
- Hop from body to body (costs 1 point for the first hop, 2 for the second, and so on)
- Increase range of telepathy & possession (another 30 feet per point)
- Increase the duration by another hour for 1 point

If you also know Ghostwalk, you can cast it to let your soul temporarily leave its jar. If your original body is dead when the duration runs out or the soul jar is destroyed, you die and return as an NPC spectre. If you spend 4+ dice you can make the soul jar or any body transfers facilitated by it permanent.

#### 13. Lichcraft
**R**: 30’ **D**: [dice] hours

You animate up to [dice] bodies into either 1HD skeletons, zombies or shadows that serve you like puppets. Instead of animating more bodies, you can use one of your spent spell dice to increase the undead HD by 1 or allow it to keep one ability or action from its living body.
You can only give your undeads 1 order per round. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the effect becomes permanent and the undeads become followers.

#### 14. Ghost Orchestra
**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

You are surrounded by the harmonious sounds of an invisible ghostly five-piece band for the duration of the spell. All of your actions now have more panache and flair. If you hide, for example, the music stops, only to burst into a dramatic loud chord jump scare, stunning surprised creatures. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.
